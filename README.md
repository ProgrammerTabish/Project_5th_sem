# Real Estate Management System

## Project Overview
The **Real Estate Management System** is designed to streamline the process of managing real estate properties. It provides a comprehensive platform for managing property listings, client interactions, and transactions. The system aims to simplify property management tasks and improve efficiency for real estate agencies.

## Features
- **Property Listings**: Manage and display property listings with details such as price, location, and specifications.
- **Client Management**: Keep track of client information, interactions, and inquiries.
- **Transaction Management**: Manage property transactions, including offers, agreements, and sales.
- **Search & Filter**: Allow users to search and filter properties based on various criteria.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and user management to ensure data privacy and access control.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## System Architecture
1. **Frontend**: The user interface, built with React, provides an intuitive platform for managing properties, clients, and transactions. It includes features for searching, filtering, and displaying property details.
2. **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js handle server-side logic, including processing requests, managing data, and interacting with the database.
3. **Database**: MongoDB is used to store information about properties, clients, and transactions.
4. **Authentication**: User authentication is managed to ensure secure access to the system.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) database

### Steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ProgrammerTabish/real-estate-management-system.git
    cd real-estate-management-system
    ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - Configure database connection in `config.js`:
     ```javascript
     module.exports = {
       db: 'mongodb://localhost:27017/real_estate'
     };
     ```
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies:
     ```bash
     cd ../frontend
     npm install
     ```
   - Start the frontend development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```

4. **Database Setup**:
   - Ensure MongoDB is running and accessible at the specified URI.
   - Import any initial data if necessary.
