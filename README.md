- **Client Management**: Keep track of client information, interactions, and inquiries.
- **Transaction Management**: Manage property transactions, including offers, agreements, and sales.
- **Search & Filter**: Allow users to search and filter properties based on various criteria.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and user management to ensure data privacy and access control.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: PHP
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## System Architecture
1. **Frontend**: The user interface, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, provides an intuitive platform for managing properties, clients, and transactions. It includes features for searching, filtering, and displaying property details.
2. **Backend**: PHP handles server-side logic, including processing requests, managing data, and interacting with the database.
3. **Database**: MySQL is used to store information about properties, clients, and transactions.
4. **Authentication**: User authentication is managed to ensure secure access to the system.

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites:
- [PHP](https://www.php.net/) and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)
- [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)

### Steps:
1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ProgrammerTabish/real-estate-management-system.git
    cd real-estate-management-system
    ```

2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Navigate to the backend directory and set up the environment:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Configure database connection in `config.php`:
     ```php
     <?php
     $dbHost = 'localhost';
     $dbName = 'real_estate';
     $dbUser = 'root';
     $dbPass = '';
     ?>
     ```
   - Import the database schema from `database.sql` into MySQL.

3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - Ensure all frontend files are in the `frontend` directory. You may need to configure the web server to serve these files.

4. **Database Setup**:
   - Ensure MySQL is running and accessible with the credentials specified in `config.php`.
   - Import any initial data if necessary.
